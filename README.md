# Smart-Grid-Data-Analysis

What is Smart Grid? 
Let’s understand this by breaking up these two words. Starting with ”Smart” which means anything which can communicate in a two way form or in which the communication is bi-directional. 
For example our smartphones, smart T.V’s, smart-watches, etc. Another terminology is ”Grid” which is a network of an electricity consisting of power and providers which are synchronized. It also consists of user who are joined via transmission and distribution lines and are controlled by one or more control centres.
So, In Smart Grid the catch is that we have bi-directional communication between utility (Electricity Service Provider) and user, possible by the presence of PLC (PowerLine Carrier). 
The transmitting lines are used for sending both data and electricity at the same time. Due to which the grid monitoring and smart metering has been a boom to energy sector, as in grid monitoring the utility gets to know the amount of electricity consumed by the user in real time. 
Alongside, it also helps in scenario where there is a power breakdown in an area which can be measured by utility. In case of smart metering the user gets to know about the amount of energy consumed by them.

# Motivation

Motivation has been to improve the utilization of electricity in an efficient way considering the bi-directional communication, will actually help utility to identify and predict which components are likely to fail.  Since the monitoring of low/medium/high voltage is possible throughout this communication infrastructure which helps in reducing the energy losses in the network. 
Eventually helps in lowering down the carbon fuel consumption and lowers down the green house effects. Alongside, also helps to gain productivity and decrease the deployment and operational cost. But, the main motivation on top of everything is to increase the customer experience by improving the services offered, introducing the new services, improving the service reliability and quality to consumers. It would enable options for renewable generation and provide customers with the awareness and capabilities to reduce their energy consumption which would help them to reduce the cost. 
Motivation has also been helping out appliance production companies to increase their productivity.

# Objective
The objective of this research are as follows:-

i) Appliance Prediction – On the basis of energy consumed by an individual consumer,
we can eventually predict the specific appliances used by a consumer. It would be
helping out appliance producing companies to achieve targeted advertising of appliance
specific to season of the year.

ii) Energy consumption by individual appliance – We also want to predict the energy
consumed by a single appliance in order to predict whether the consumer should upgrade their appliance or not, which would eventually help to reduce cost and power
consumption.

iii) Predicting Star Rating of an individual appliance – We aim to predict the star rating
of an individual appliance as well, reason being if a consumer is using an appliance
with a lower star rating, he/she would be actually generating higher electricity cost, so
we can suggest them to switch to an appliance with a higher star rating and how much
cost would it be saving.

iv) Targeted Marketing For Appliance Developing Companies – The prediction of star
rating could actually help companies to predict that how many people would be possibly
opting to upgrade to a appliance with a higher star rating, so they can accordingly target
their sales.
